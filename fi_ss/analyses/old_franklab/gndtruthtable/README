Notes about sorting neto-kampff 128-channel datasets. Barnett.

See netokampff/extracting_juxta128n*.m for MATLAB code to convert downloaded
files from
http://www.kampff-lab.org/validating-electrodes/
into MDA for mountainsort.


juxta128n1 : downloaded name 2015_09_03_Pair_9_0, closest electrode case (29um)
juxta128n2 : downloaded name 2015_09_04_Pair_5_0, next closest (72um).

There are some subsets of channels and shorter times datasets too.






------------------------- old notes from 4-6-17:

Conclusion: for the 2nd-closest 128-ch (jux128n2), 99% of events are false pos, and only ~20 events out of 243 match.
It is impossible to spike sort this neuron.

For closest (jux128n1), 
jux128n1 is 10-min * 128 ch:
10 min to sort.
14 min if merge.
