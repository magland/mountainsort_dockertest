sorting of Neto-Kampff data for which there's juxtacellular
ground truth.

Go to 2nd in the 128-channel set.
Data is around 6 GB.
Barnett 3/30/17

30kHz
juxta is 72 um (intermediate distance)
from electrode 110 (bottom end of probe)

for analyses see fi_ss/analyses/franklab/gndtruthtable/

Setup notes:
Compile mountainlab. Needed to fix mdaio.cpp!
Edit mountainlab.user.json to point to new ms2 pipelines, eg "pipeline_paths":["mountainsort/pipelines","/user/pipelines","packages/mountainsort2/algs/"]

cd /data/ahb/neuron/fi_ss/datasets/netokampff/juxta128_2
prv-create /data/ahb/neuron/Kampff/2015_09_04_Pair_5_0/kampff128_2_raw.mda raw.mda.prv

# check it worked:
prv-locate raw.mda.prv
# gives: /data/ahb/neuron/Kampff/2015_09_04_Pair_5_0/kampff128_2_raw.mda

# set up pipelines.txt and datasets.txt in
# /data/ahb/neuron/fi_ss/analyses/franklab/gndtruthtable

# point to pipelines in mountainlab/

addpath mountainlab/matlab/msutils/ 
addpath mountainlab/matlab/processing/

# fi_ss should ship a use.json example ?

kron-run ms2 jux128n2 --_nodaemon

crashes out at bandpass

but example2 etc works with ms2

# need util to check a file is a valid MDA: it's "mda":
mda raw.mda
#outputs a json w/ params.

# failure for 128 ch - fixed, was int32 vs 64 issue. MN>2^31

BUt why
kron-run msmu jux128n2sh --_nodaemon
which has only -1 sign, ran instantly and gave exactly K=285 as in sign=0 (msu)?
