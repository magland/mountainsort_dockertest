# MountainLab

MountainSort is spike sorting software developed by Jeremy Magland, Alex Barnett, and Leslie Greengard at the Center for Computational Biology, Flatiron Institute in close collaboration with Jason Chung and Loren Frank at UCSF department of Physiology. It is part of MountainLab, a general framework for data analysis and visualization.

MountainLab software is being developed by Jeremy Magland and Witold Wysota.

The software comprises tools for processing electrophysiological recordings and for visualizing and validating the results.

Contact the authors for information on the slack team for users and developers.
